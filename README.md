# ðŸŽ§ Spotify ETL Pipeline using AWS & Snowflake

This project is a **serverless ETL pipeline** that collects data from the **Spotify API**, processes it using **AWS Lambda**, stores it in **Amazon S3**, and automatically loads it into **Snowflake** using **Snowpipe** â€” making the data instantly available for analysis.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Spotify API** â€“ Source of playlist data  
- **AWS Lambda** â€“ Serverless functions for extract and transform  
- **Amazon S3** â€“ Raw and processed data storage  
- **Snowflake** â€“ Cloud data warehouse  
- **Snowpipe** â€“ Automated data loading into Snowflake tables  
- **Python** â€“ Used for scripting Lambda functions

## ðŸ”„ How the Pipeline Works

1. **Extract**  
   A scheduled Lambda function connects to the Spotify API and pulls track data (e.g., song name, artist, album, duration). It saves the raw JSON response to an S3 bucket.

2. **Transform**  
   When new data is uploaded to S3, an S3 event triggers another Lambda function. This function cleans and reshapes the data into three structured CSV files: `songs`, `albums`, and `artists`. These files are then stored in a processed folder in S3.

3. **Load**  
   Snowpipe continuously monitors the processed folder in S3. When new CSV files are detected, it automatically loads them into corresponding tables in Snowflake â€” with relationships preserved via primary and foreign keys.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Project Matters

- It shows how raw API data can be turned into structured, query-ready tables in an automated way.
- Demonstrates key concepts of modern **data engineering**: event-driven processing, serverless architecture, and scalable cloud-based data warehousing.
- Can be extended to support other APIs or analytics use cases with minimal effort.
